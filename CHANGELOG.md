## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-24

### Added
- Professional GitHub repository structure with organized directories
- Comprehensive README.md with badges and detailed documentation
- LICENSE file (MIT + Educational Use)
- CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines
- .gitignore for Python projects
- Tests directory with all test files organized

### Changed
- Reorganized project structure with `docs/`, `tests/`, and `archive/` directories
- Moved legacy files to `archive/` for reference
- Consolidated documentation into `docs/` folder

### Fixed
- Repository organization for production-ready deployment

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-24

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Ineffective waypoint optimization - now intelligently distributes waypoints
  - Straight sections: 4-7 waypoints (was 15-20)
  - Curved sections: Adaptive density based on curvature
  - Enabled path smoothing (200.0) to filter mouse jitter
  - Implemented three-tier distance scaling (400mm, 300mm, 50-150mm)

### Changed
- Path interpolator now uses smoothness parameter of 200.0 (was 0.0)
- Waypoint optimizer uses adaptive curvature thresholding
- Improved distance scaling based on path geometry

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-24

### Added
- Automatic path direction detection and normalization
- User feedback for auto-corrected paths

### Fixed
- **High Priority**: Path direction rejection issue
  - Paths can now be drawn in either direction (START→END or END→START)
  - System automatically normalizes path orientation
  - Clear user feedback when auto-correction occurs

### Changed
- Path validation now accepts paths connecting endpoints in either direction
- Enhanced validation messages with more helpful information

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-24

### Fixed
- **Critical**: False zigzag detection causing all paths to be rejected
  - Disabled strict zigzag validation that was incompatible with mouse-drawn paths
  - System now focuses on essential validations (endpoints, length)
  - Improved user experience by accepting naturally-drawn paths

### Changed
- Path validation now prioritizes interpolation and optimization over geometric constraints
- Clearer validation error messages

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-24

### Added
- Initial production-ready release
- Mission-based learning system (4 progressive missions)
- Intelligent waypoint optimization using curvature analysis
- Dual-layer path visualization (drawn vs optimized)
- Comprehensive path validation
- Real-world coordinate transformation (canvas ↔ arena)
- Professional UI with modern Material Design styling
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Complete test suite
- Comprehensive documentation

### Features
- **Mission System**: 4 missions with 1-4 robots, progressive difficulty
- **Path Drawing**: Intuitive click-and-drag interface
- **Smart Optimization**: B-spline interpolation + curvature-based waypoint placement
- **Validation**: Start/end point checking, minimum length, geometry validation
- **Coordinate Transform**: 800×800 canvas → 2000×2000mm arena
- **Output Format**: Python-ready waypoint arrays in millimeters
