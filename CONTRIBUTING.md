1. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Keep commits focused and atomic

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   python -m pytest tests/
   
   # Run specific test
   python tests/test_your_feature.py
   
   # Manual testing
   python robot_path_planner.py
   ```

4. **Submit a pull request**
   - Provide a clear description of changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Ensure all tests pass

## üé® Code Style

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Write docstrings for classes and functions
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible

**Example:**
```python
def optimize_waypoints(self, path: List[Tuple[float, float]]) -> List[Tuple[float, float]]:
    """
    Optimize path waypoints based on curvature analysis.
    
    Args:
        path: List of (x, y) coordinates along the path
        
    Returns:
        List of optimized waypoints (always exactly 20 points)
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Code Organization

- Keep modules focused on single responsibilities
- Separate GUI logic from business logic
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex algorithms

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Include both unit tests and integration tests
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## üìö Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Use clear, concise comments for complex logic
- Update existing documentation when changing behavior

### User Documentation

When adding features that affect users:
- Update README.md with new functionality
- Add examples to docs/QUICKSTART.md if appropriate
- Update docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for structural changes

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
python tests/test_integration.py
```

### Writing Tests

Create test files in the `tests/` directory:

```python
import pytest
from path_optimizer import WaypointOptimizer

def test_waypoint_optimization():
    """Test that waypoints are optimized correctly."""
    optimizer = WaypointOptimizer(min_distance_mm=100.0)
    
    # Create test path
    path = [(0, 0), (100, 100), (200, 200)]
    
    # Optimize
    waypoints = optimizer.optimize_waypoints(path)
    
    # Verify
    assert len(waypoints) == 20
    assert waypoints[0] == path[0]
    assert waypoints[-1] == path[-1]
```

## üêõ Debugging

### Common Issues

**Import errors:**
```bash
# Ensure you're in the project root
cd /path/to/robot-path-planner

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**GUI doesn't display:**
- Check PyQt5 installation: `pip install --upgrade PyQt5`
- Verify Python version: `python --version` (need 3.7+)

**Tests failing:**
- Run with verbose output: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
- Check for dependency issues: `pip list`
